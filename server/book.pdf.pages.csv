Page 6,"INTRODUCTION I started my career chasing unicorns. I joined Pinterest as employee number two, but in 2011, I left before my stock vested to build my own billion-dollar company. I had spent a weekend building the prototype of Gumroad, a tool that helped creators sell their products online. No complicated setup. No elaborate storefront. Just a link for customers to pay and you’re in business. More than fifty thousand people visited the site on the first day, and I was sure I was on the cusp of something big. The first step: raising money from VCs. As a nineteen-year-old solo founder, I found myself walking up and down the mythical Sand Hill Road, sweating through my jeans, having meetings in the same rooms where the decisions to fund companies like Netflix, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google had happened. I ended up raising more than $8 million in venture capital from renowned Silicon Valley investors, including Accel Partners (early investor in Facebook), Kleiner Perkins (early investor in Google, Amazon, and Apple), Max Levchin (cofounder of PayPal), Naval Ravikant (cofounder of AngelList), and Chris Sacca (early investor in Twitter, Square, and Uber). They too thought they saw a unicorn galloping in the distance. The chase was on. In short order, I built a world-class team—recruiting talent out of companies like Stripe, Yelp, and Amazon—and together we went to work on building a world-class product. I was confident that I’d soon be strolling through Allen & Company’s annual Sun Valley conference, strategizing about the fight against malaria arm-in-arm with Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. I was never in it for the money, I told myself. I wanted to",375
Page 7,"make an impact, but quietly. When I became a tech titan, I was going to be the kind of titan magazine profiles called “down-to-earth.” I didn’t make it to Sun Valley that summer. Or the summer after that. The closest I ever got to Bill Gates was watching him speak at a Kleiner Perkins CEO summit. Gumroad’s pitched flight into the stratosphere leveled off after we burned through about $10 million in venture capital. After nine months of trying to raise more funding, we failed. In October 2015, I laid off three- quarters of the staff—including many good friends. Once the bleeding stopped, it was time to reassess. Gumroad was still operational, but I felt like a complete failure. With many in my circle still focused on raising money, hiring employees, and chasing their own billion- dollar companies—some successfully—I couldn’t bear to stick around Silicon Valley. For much of 2016, I kept my apartment in San Francisco but spent most of my time traveling and writing fiction, convinced that even if I couldn’t hack it in Startupland, I could still build a life for myself as a digital nomad. While I was inspired by Tim Ferriss’s The 4-Hour Workweek, it didn’t take long to realize that operating Gumroad as a lifestyle business wasn’t for me. I was still trying to figure out what came next when I saw a tweet from Brandon Sanderson, one of my favorite authors, about a science- fiction and fantasy writing class he was teaching in Provo, Utah. In January 2017, I jumped on the opportunity to save rent and save face by moving to a place where no one knew me. There, I could figure out how to regroup even as I kept Gumroad afloat. I knew things would be very different in Provo, but the contrast still surprised me. In San Francisco, being successful means you’ve made a lot of money (which, in San Francisco, is a lot of money). In Utah, it means you’re married and active in the church. My new Provo friends told me that I’d been crazy trying to build a billion-dollar company in the first place. Why wasn’t Gumroad good enough as it was? After all, I had a sustainable business serving a group of customers I loved. What more could I want? At first, I couldn’t quite grasp what they were talking about, but after living in Provo for a couple of years away from the white-hot epicenter of venture capital, I came to agree. While the unicorn I was chasing turned out to be more of a Shetland pony, my original vision was being realized. Thousands of creators were using Gumroad to build their own creative businesses. Real people in the real world were paying their mortgages or",603
Page 8,"topping off their kids’ college funds or simply paying for a few extra lattes by selling courses, ebooks, and software online. Over time, I realized that the problem wasn’t Gumroad, the problem was me. I was still so focused on that elusive unicorn, I couldn’t see the thriving business humming along right in front of me. Gumroad was profitable, the right size for its market, and enabling more and more writers, coders, crafters, and other makers to achieve their dreams with each passing day. Gumroad may have been a crappy investment for a few venture capitalists, but it was still a great company for its customers. In the year after the layoffs, when I worked by myself, Gumroad still sent approximately $40 million to our creators, without any content marketing or paid advertising. Just creators telling other creators. When I recommitted to growing the company again in 2019, I continued to say no to those things I had said yes to previously, and focused solely on what would create more value for our creators. (Namely, shipping a better product.) It worked: In 2020 Gumroad sent more than $140 million to our creators, up 87 percent over the year before, all while remaining profitable. Companies like mine may not grace the covers of glossy magazines or inspire Hollywood biopics, but they drive real, positive change and empower their founders, customers, and employees alike. I know that now, but it took me years to decouple my self-worth from my net worth and to realize that I hadn’t failed. I had succeeded. In February 2019, I wrote about my experience in a Medium essay, “Reflecting on My Failure to Build a Billion-Dollar Company,” that struck a chord with millions. Since then, I’ve had the chance to connect with entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs who, deep down, would much rather build a sustainable business like Gumroad than chase a unicorn. They just think it’s weird and uncool to express that desire when the media and our bigger-is-better culture keeps telling them that a unicorn is the only kind of business worth creating. While that may be the right path for some companies, for many more it’s not. Yet plenty of early-stage startups still end up raising venture capital because they can’t fund their businesses in a sustainable way through profits. As a result, they’re locked into the pursuit of huge, winner-take-all markets where growth is the most important asset of their businesses, not revenues, profits, or sustainability.",539
Page 9,"To help me reconcile those differences, I asked myself certain questions over and over again: What do I actually care to change? If I could fix one thing about my corner of the world, what would that be? What kind of business do I really want to build, own, and run? Other founders and future founders have asked themselves similar questions and come to similar realizations. Many of their stories are included in this book. I call these people “minimalist entrepreneurs,” and I call their companies “minimalist businesses.” Building a minimalist business does not mean settling for second best. Instead, it’s about creating sustainable companies that have the flexibility to take risks to serve the greater good, all while empowering others to do the same. Being profitable, hopefully from the very beginning, means being able to focus and to stay focused on the reason you started a business in the first place: to help others. Historically, entrepreneurs have played a crucial role in driving technological and social progress. This is even more necessary today, when big corporations are required by law to prioritize shareholder value over, among other things, actual value. In researching this book, I’ve found countless examples of businesses such as Basecamp, Wistia, Missouri Star Quilt Company, and many other honest-to-goodness, highly scalable companies incredibly focused on solving meaningful problems with beautiful products, services, and software that people love—and making a profit doing it. Each company goes about things their own way depending on the specific community they’re building for, but they all focus on problem- solving and not taking themselves too seriously. No matter their differences, we can learn from them all. Unfortunately, the word “entrepreneur” has a weird taint to it. I remember going to a “Career Fair” at school and not identifying with the “entrepreneurs” at all. They seemed like businessmen (they were always men), and I didn’t even like business. I liked making things! Eventually I realized that a business is not an end in and of itself. A business is a tool to make or do stuff, a legal structure; that’s it. At first I didn’t need a company, but eventually my creations required a legal structure, a team, and an operation to make the stuff I wanted to make, so I started a business. When I made my transition from unicorn chaser to minimalist entrepreneur, I had to wrap my head around another new normal. This book is about deconstructing the myths we tell ourselves about the best way to",542
Page 10,"build impactful businesses to change the abstract, singular “world,” and about seeking the truth about how to build the businesses that will make us and our communities wealthier, healthier, and happier. In the end, my failure to launch Gumroad into the stratosphere was the best thing that ever happened to me, because it taught me the very real consequences behind a “growth at all costs” mindset. Unfortunately, it took me eight years, and a lot of pain, to realize it. I hope this book will help other aspiring entrepreneurs learn the lessons I learned without the painful layoffs and years of soul-searching. The overwhelming response to the viral essay I wrote about my experience is more proof that this promise resonates with many. This book, part manifesto, part manual, will help you design, build, and successfully grow your own right-size business. Read it again and again, especially when you feel stuck. But keep in mind that you definitely do not need to finish this book to start. Start as soon as you can. Start before you feel ready. Start today. You don’t learn, then start. You start, then learn. Now, let’s get to it!",253
Page 11,1 the minimalist entrepreneur The beginnings of all things are small. —CICERO,20
Page 12,"Atlanta-based web developer Peter Askew loves to get things off the top shelf at the supermarket for people who can’t reach the same heights he can. A six-foot-eight former high school basketball star, Askew sees being helpful as the pillar of his business strategy, but it wasn’t always that way. When the dot-com bubble burst in 2001 and he was laid off from eTour, a websurfing guide he helped build and grow, he had to ask himself, “Is this how I want to live? Is this how I can be of service to the world?” He knew he could get another job thanks to his background in marketing analytics, but he was also disillusioned. Money and prestige were not nearly as important to him as independence and freedom. Eventually he wound up with another role in advertising where he was exposed to a wide range of business models as thousands of new web businesses came online, but in the evening and on weekends, he threw himself into his side projects, learning about web development, domain names, and how to monetize web traffic. That’s how he stumbled on an idea that would change his life. What if instead of buying new domain names, which often took months to rank highly in search engine results, he bought expired domain names, which already had some degree of visibility? Other people were parking ads on expired domains or flipping them, but Askew had something else in mind, the seed of an idea that was driven by the questions he had started to ask himself about his work. Rather than trying to make a quick buck, he would build real businesses around domain names, asking himself with each one, “Do I feel inspired? Is there a real business here?,” and, most of all, “Can I be helpful?” He experimented with randomly created names and ventures that didn’t quite work before he realized that “the domain name always comes first, the business idea comes second.” In 2009, that domain name was duderanch.com. Askew bought it and launched a directory, traveling to more than fifty dude ranches to meet the owners of the destinations he featured on his site. Eventually he partnered with the owner of guestranches.com, and the two built a curated list of destination ranches around the country. The success of that venture, which he worked on for ten years and sold in 2019, gave him the time and financial freedom to buy",515
Page 13,"more domain names and develop other niche businesses. Some succeeded, others didn’t. In 2014, Askew saw that VidaliaOnions.com was up for auction. Until then, he had focused on information-based businesses, but something about the domain name appealed to him. So did the onions, frankly. As a Georgia native, he knew of Vidalias—a sweet, mild variety that some fans eat raw like an apple. The only trouble was that he didn’t know anything about the onion business. Or farming in general, for that matter. Regardless, he put down a $2,200 bid, confident that someone in the business would come in higher. (If bidding on interesting domain names like this sounds like a neat hobby, you may be a minimalist entrepreneur.) When he won the auction five minutes later, he was pleasantly surprised, but he filed it away for later and went back to work on other projects. As the days went by, though, he couldn’t stop thinking about Vidalias. “[The domain] kept nudging me,” he writes in his essay “I Sell Onions on the Internet,” and “after a month, I began to understand what it was telling me. That I buy pears from Harry & David every year, and I should mimic that same service for Vidalia onions. Instead of farm-to-door pears, farm-to- door Vidalia onions.” He saw a way he could be helpful to others, and a new minimalist business was born. Askew didn’t eat Vidalias himself, but he knew that many people did, both from his own experience and from strong search volume for the phrase on Google Trends. But he still had his doubts. “I’m not a farmer,” he worried. “I have no logistics or distribution system setup.” He got started anyway. His first step was to reach out to a trade group that put him in touch with Aries Haygood, the owner of an award-winning Vidalia farm in operation for over two decades that had, crucially, a packing shed. He used his own money to put up a new site on VidaliaOnions.com, and then, “[while] the farm concentrated on the Vidalia, I concentrated on customer service, marketing, branding, web development, & logistics,” he recalled. “I didn’t have other projects that were this front-facing, customer wise. And I discovered I immensely enjoyed it.” Askew and Haygood estimated fifty orders for their first season. They received more than six hundred. It would be at this point in the life cycle of a VC-funded business that the investors would start getting frisky. “Six hundred orders when we expected fifty?” they’d exclaim. “Time to quintuple your hiring. Come to think of it,",619
Page 14,"what does the international market for Vidalia onions look like? A few million in ad spending, a viral video, and we’ll have Vidalias trending worldwide. We’ll probably need people on the ground in London, Tokyo, and Sydney. Time to raise another round.” And on it goes. Picture a little kid blowing a balloon up for the first time, until . . . Askew himself couldn’t help but consider trying to accelerate the company’s growth, but he stuck to what he had learned over the years and focused instead on profitability. He knew that the previous owners of VidaliaOnions.com had gone belly up trying to sell salad dressings and relishes in addition to the onions themselves. So instead, he slowly built the business in front of him, figuring out how to sell Vidalia onions to the market of potential customers within the range of timely and affordable shipping from that one packing shed. He made mistakes, of course. At one point, he lost thousands of dollars on faulty shipping boxes, an error that nearly shuttered the operation. But he also made small process improvements year by year, like implementing an automated shipping system rather than manually entering customer orders and printing UPS labels. A few years in, the business was profitable, growing organically at its own pace, and he was having fun. Six years in, Askew’s pet project has become a full-fledged business, which makes his many customers happy and has a positive impact in the local community. He no longer sees it as just another experiment along with all of his other cast-off domain names. VidaliaOnions.com is becoming his mission: Honestly, my customers would be quite upset if we disappeared. Last season, while I called a gentleman back regarding a phone order, his wife answered. While I introduced myself, she interrupted me mid- sentence and hollered in exaltation to her husband: “THE VIDALIA MAN! THE VIDALIA MAN! PICK UP THE PHONE!” At that moment, I realized we were doing something right. Something helpful. Something that was making a positive impact. . . . It’s immensely gratifying. I feel so fortunate to be associated with this industry.",470
Page 15,"Maybe it’s the onions, but Askew’s story brings a tear to my eye. There is something profoundly beautiful in a value-oriented mission and a genuine purpose driven by your own lived experience. This is what being a minimalist entrepreneur is all about: making a difference while making a living. The Minimalist Entrepreneur Before I started to write this book, I wouldn’t have described myself as a minimalist entrepreneur. I would have said I was a founder committed to a new kind of startup, one that prioritized profitability over growth and positive impact over moving fast and breaking things. Instead of capturing as much value as possible, I was determined to create as much value as possible for our customers and our community. I’m not the only one. In this book, you’ll meet dozens of entrepreneurs like Peter Askew and others who are taking the same approach to building their companies. In the past years, I’ve exchanged ideas on Twitter or at conferences with all of them, and the more people I talked to, the more I felt we should label this new pathway that uses the advent of software to democratize and normalize business creation for everyone. Minimalist entrepreneurs are all unique, as is every path to success, but I’ve tried my best to coalesce my learnings into a single, repeatable playbook. The steps to becoming a minimalist entrepreneur map to a function of the minimalist business—and, not coincidentally, to the chapters in this book. Each chapter builds on the previous one—just as addition leads to multiplication leads to algebra leads to calculus—until finally, at the end of the book, you’ll be fully equipped to become a minimalist entrepreneur yourself. You can read it all the way through, but you should also feel free to hop around; everyone is at a different stage in their business-building journey. PUT PROFITABILITY FIRST Minimalist entrepreneurs create businesses that are profitable at all costs. Many businesses never intend to stick around long enough to be profitable. Instead, the plan is to sell the business before profits become necessary, raising money from investors",444
Page 16,"along the way. Minimalist entrepreneurs aim to be profitable from day one or soon after, because profit is oxygen for businesses. And they do that by selling a product to customers, not by selling their users to advertisers. START WITH COMMUNITY Minimalist entrepreneurs build on a foundation of community. They don’t ask “How can I help?” but are instead observant and cultivate authentic relationships. They spend time and effort to learn and to build trust, focusing on the market part of “product-market fit” (a term coined by venture capitalist Marc Andreessen for being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market) before they build anything at all. BUILD AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE When they do build, minimalist entrepreneurs build only what they need to, automating or outsourcing the rest. Similarly, minimalist businesses do one thing and do it well. They work side by side with their customers to iterate toward a solution, and make sure it’s worth paying for, before they take it to customers outside of their communities. SELL TO YOUR FIRST HUNDRED CUSTOMERS Minimalist entrepreneurs don’t spend time convincing people —they spend time educating people. Selling is a discovery process, and minimalist entrepreneurs use sales as an opportunity to talk to potential customers one by one about their products while simultaneously educating themselves about the problem they are trying to solve for them. Selling this way is a long game built on relationships and vulnerability, not a one-day grand opening extravaganza followed by selling to strangers. MARKET BY BEING YOU Speaking of vulnerability, minimalist entrepreneurs share their stories, from struggle to success. The best marketing shows the world who you—and your product—really are. Minimalist entrepreneurs understand that people care about other people, and educate, inspire, and entertain whenever and wherever they can. Instead of making headlines, they make fans —who turn themselves into customers over time.",407
Page 17,"GROW YOURSELF AND YOUR BUSINESS MINDFULLY Minimalist entrepreneurs own their businesses, they don’t let their businesses own them. They don’t spend money they don’t have, and they don’t sacrifice profitability for scale. At this point, it becomes a game to lose . . . and minimalist entrepreneurs don’t lose. BUILD THE HOUSE YOU WANT TO LIVE IN Minimalist entrepreneurs hire other minimalist entrepreneurs. Instead of following the status quo, they build their companies from first principles, alienating almost everyone. The way you do things won’t be for everyone, but it will be really great for a few people, and if you define your values early and often and tell the world who you are, they will find you. Conventional wisdom about how we work, when we work, and where we work is changing fast. Minimalist entrepreneurs understand there are few rules. Even when you’ve successfully built your minimalist business, the journey isn’t over. Spoiler alert: It never is. Minimalist entrepreneurs know that life is about more than just their companies. The true magic of entrepreneurship is that you and your business can improve the quality of life of many people. And it doesn’t have to be millions; “enough” is what you decide it is, not a specific amount. If you’re nodding along, great. If you’re still skeptical, well, that’s okay too. I have 50,000 words and a few hours to convince you. Just keep reading! Chase Profitability, Not Unicorns Building a minimalist business is not a get-rich-quick proposition, but it is a get-rich-slowly one if you embrace profitability, not growth, as the key indicator of your company’s success. Profitability means sustainability. Instead of treading water until a lifeboat comes along to save you—which is how many founders think about raising their next round of VC funding—it means building your own boat.",427
Page 18,"And while I do think the minimalist entrepreneur mindset leads to a near- 100-percent success rate, I’m willing to concede that it may only happen over the course of many experiments. That’s why profitability matters. If you’re profitable, you can take unlimited shots on goal, virtually guaranteeing your success as long as you keep learning from your customers. Most people don’t start. Most people who start don’t continue. Most people who continue give up. Many winners are just the last ones standing. Don’t give up. We’re moving past an era of gatekeeping, where bosses and universities and venture capitalists decide who gets to try and who doesn’t. Information about how to start and scale companies is now available to founders around the world, and it’s cheaper too, which means there are fewer and fewer reasons to raise money from venture capitalists. There’s nothing inherently wrong with raising money, and not all unicorns are evil. I raised money for Gumroad (and, as you’ll read later, have again, but in a very different way), and there are companies like Pinterest, Lyft, Slack, and others that raised venture capital, grew quickly, yet stayed focused on their customers. But much of the venture capital model depends on creating unsustainable growth and destroying successful-by-any-other-metric businesses. Why does this happen? The venture capital business is a high-risk, high- return investment strategy in which venture funds swap capital for early- stage startup equity, essentially buying a piece of the future value of the companies in which they invest. For the model to work, the rare winners like Uber, Airbnb, and Stripe need to pay for all the losers. Aileen Lee of Cowboy Ventures coined the term “unicorn” to refer to privately held startups valued at more than $1 billion, which are the lifeblood of venture funds. In fairy tales, people can’t help chasing unicorns—they are nearly irresistible, but they’re also rare, elusive, and nearly impossible to catch. Her mythological metaphor couldn’t have been more apt. Almost everyone fails to build billion-dollar businesses, even the founders who raise gobs of venture capital. According to Matt Murphy, managing director and partner of Menlo Ventures, approximately 70 percent of startups fail, which can mean anything from full liquidation to becoming cash flow positive, which, despite being good for the company, is still bad for the VC. Of the 30 percent still standing, he says, some return three to five times the initial investment, which constitutes only modest success in this setting. The whole system is riding on at least 5 percent of VC-backed companies",568
Page 19,"delivering tenfold to one hundredfold returns to balance out losses and make it all worth it. Without them, the VC model simply doesn’t work. That’s because the outsized success of the rare billion-dollar startup compensates for all the money thrown against the wall, like so much spaghetti, on thousands of other ventures. That’s not what minimalist entrepreneurs do. We are laser focused on profitability from day one, in order to get to sustainability soon after, so that we can serve our customers and our communities for as long as we wish. Don’t Call It a Comeback No matter where you work, how you work, or who you work for right now, you can use the principles in this book to rethink the beliefs and practices that may be holding you back. I really do believe that starting a business should be an option for everyone, no matter your background. That’s why this book is full of examples of many great businesses that have been built by passionate individuals around the world, many who have flown under the radar until now. For up-and-coming minimalist entrepreneurs, I hope their stories can serve as examples as new online tools make the process of building, marketing, and selling easier and cheaper for everyone—including solopreneurs and independent creators. Where do you start? Take a good hard look at the people, places, and communities you care about. Where are the pain points? What isn’t working, but might with a little elbow grease? These are all opportunities to make things better through minimalist entrepreneurship. It’s ironic to me how often people go around hoping to find a startup idea while simultaneously complaining about all the everyday stuff around them that doesn’t work properly. “Sure, I could solve that for people with a little effort, but the potential market just isn’t big enough to really scale.” That’s the kind of thinking that this book seeks to address. You may already be on your business-building journey, but if you’re just getting started, some business models lend themselves more easily to the pathway of minimalist entrepreneurship. These include almost any kind of business-to-consumer or business-to-business enterprise that has fast customer feedback loops and ample opportunities for iteration like software as a service (SaaS), digital and physical products and services, or connecting people for a fee. We’ll talk about all of these later in the book.",511
Page 20,"There are also businesses that aren’t necessarily suited for this framework because of the slow pace of customer feedback. For example, any business that requires a heavy investment in research and development or that relies on sales to large, bureaucratized corporations or institutions—like Fortune 100 companies, academia, or hospitals—might not match up as well with the processes and systems I recommend. The good news is that what constitutes a “business” is changing faster than ever before and opening up possibilities to a wider range of innovators. Though this shift was in motion before 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated it and drove increased interest in entrepreneurship from people of all backgrounds. Now more than ever before, we don’t need to move to a place called Silicon Valley, go to a school called Harvard or Stanford, and raise money from the venture capitalists. The internet lets you learn from anywhere, network with anyone, and raise money directly from customers. The world desperately needs the solutions that only entrepreneurs can provide. Everyday problems are all around us, but they are often hidden from the view of the Silicon Valley software engineers and Ivy League overachievers who have been anointed as our entrepreneurial class. We need the help of entrepreneurs from every part of the planet and every stratum of society. It’s down to individual creators and entrepreneurs to set better goals for ourselves and our businesses. After all, problems don’t solve themselves. People do. Creator First, Entrepreneur Second On paper, it seems simple enough: 1. Narrow down who your ideal customer is. Narrow until you can narrow no more. 2. Define exactly what pain point you are solving for them, and how much they will pay you to solve it. 3. Set a hard deadline and focus fully on building a solution, then charge for it. 4. Repeat the process until you’ve found a product that works, then scale a business around it.",401
Page 21,"In practice, it’s not so simple. There are many complications that pop up, and most people don’t even know where to start. A “business” of any kind is too scary, too amorphous, or too unattainable. Luckily, there’s another way to get started today. Before you become an entrepreneur, become a creator. That could mean being an artist, but it doesn’t have to. Creators make things, charge their audiences for those things, and then use that money to make more things. They use the first dollars they earn as tools to fuel their own creative drive, not the other way around. With time and experience, creators show others how to turn their own creativity into businesses, and the cycle continues. In the end, there isn’t much difference between a business like Gumroad and a creator. It’s just semantics—one or more people using the tool of a business to make something new. Painters need brushes. Writers need pencils. Creators need businesses. It’s key for people to understand that, because it lowers the cognitive barrier to starting a business, and starting is really important. You don’t learn, then start. You start, then learn. My best friend in middle school, obsessed with the computer game World of Warcraft, started designing fantasy creatures in Photoshop. I was impressed, but I also remember thinking, “I could do that.” So I went through some Photoshop tutorials and got to work. When I started to get the hang of the software, I began submitting logos to online competitions. I didn’t win any, but the process of creating a lot of stuff and putting it out there made me a pretty decent designer, and then led to freelance web design work. Once you’re working on other people’s projects, you can’t help but get ideas of your own, so I began building simple web applications, hiring developers to help with the coding. For example, before Twitter natively supported threads, I created an app called Tweader to see the conversations that happened between people on Twitter. Another app, Ping Me When It’s Up, would text me when a website that had gone down was back up again. (It should be clear by now that I’ve never been very good at naming things.) When the iPhone App Store opened, I learned to code for it by taking a free course on iOS development from Stanford through iTunes University, called CS193P (I still recommend it!). The App Store handled all the financial aspects of selling what I made to customers around the world, which meant I could focus on creating apps. Perfect.",563
Page 22,"The first app I built was called Taxi Lah!, which let users call a cab from their phones—before Uber. I put it on the App Store for fellow Singaporeans and made a few thousand dollars. Then I made an app called Color Stream that let designers create and modify color palettes on their phones. I made about $10,000 from that. Each time, I was trying to solve a problem I had. I wanted to design and build a little bit of software to make my life—and the lives of others—a little bit better. This experience—shipping real products to real customers—led to my first job at Pinterest, where I designed and built the Pinterest iPhone app. While I was there, I built Gumroad in my spare time to help me sell an icon I designed in Photoshop. When I found a solution that worked, I sold it to other creators, who sold their products to their own community of creators, many of whom eventually became Gumroad customers themselves. Now I’m an honest-to-goodness entrepreneur without ever having really given it much conscious thought along the way. The App Store cleared the marketing and financial obstacles out of my way so that I could fully embrace my creative side and become a creator. That transition led to me becoming a founder. It’s an upward, virtuous cycle. Creation begets more creation. Today, Gumroad does the exact same thing for other would-be creators. It’s basically a glorified Sahil-cloning factory. Isn’t that beautiful? (My mom thinks it is.) Max Ulichney is an art director and illustrator based in Los Angeles. He’d always imagined he’d spend his days working at a large company to pay the bills in return for a few hours in the evening to do his own work. He spent fifteen years as an art director at the same creative agency, eventually using an iPad app called Procreate to draw and paint in between meetings. One day, a couple of years ago, Max decided to sell some of the digital “brushes” he’d designed for his own use to other Procreate users. A few hundred dollars later, he decided it was worth the effort to continue selling the digital tools as a business. Two years in, Max was making a living as an independent creator. Recently, he quit his job at the agency to work on Maxpacks full-time. There are thousands of “creator first, entrepreneur second” stories like Max’s. Adam Wathan and Steve Schoger teach people how to build and design web applications. They believe, as I do, that nearly anyone can become a competent front-end engineer and designer with a little help. In December",569

Now they get to spend their time doing what they really love: building Tailwind, a free and open-source framework for the rapid creation of custom web designs. Kristina Garner, mother of two boys, teaches families how to run secular, nature-based homeschooling programs for their kids. What started as a blog in 2015 about her personal passion has become Blossom and Root, a business that employs dozens of people and helps thousands of families every month. These are just a few of the 28,207 creators who sold something on Gumroad last month. That sounds like a big number today, but I too started somewhere smaller and less lofty, where creation always begins: at the number next to zero. Where there was nothing, now there’s something: digital brushes, online courses, Vidalia onions on your doorstep. In the next chapter, I’ll show you how to get started. KEY TAKEAWAYS You don’t learn, then start. You start, then learn. Minimalist entrepreneurs focus on getting “profitable at all costs” instead of growing at all costs.

Page 26,"In 2009, Sol Orwell was overweight and unhappy, so he decided to join the “r/Fitness” subreddit, one of the thousands of smaller online communities within Reddit, to find information and support. At the same time, he started reading about fitness and nutrition, taking notes on what he was learning in books like Tim Ferriss’s The 4-Hour Body and posting summaries on the fitness subreddit for other members of the community. Reddit was a natural place for Orwell to seek connection. He was already participating in the NBA and Toronto subreddits, among others, so he knew and understood Reddit’s rules and norms about posting only authentic, useful content. The more he learned about fitness and nutrition, the more he shared. In addition to his reading notes, he inspired others by answering questions and documenting his personal journey of losing sixty pounds, which occurred over a period of several years. He credits his physical transformation to the relationships he formed with other “redditors,” including Kurtis Frank, one of the moderators of r/Fitness. Eventually, Sol and Kurtis ended up moderating the subreddit together, and as time went by, they noticed two persistent problems. First, little reliable information was available about nutritional supplements, either from other redditors or from the companies that made these products; second, almost every day, new members asked the same questions over and over again, many times about supplements. Sol was frustrated by both situations, but eventually he realized that maybe the resources people needed just weren’t out there. Sol and Kurtis saw a job to be done for a community that they cared about and had nurtured from five thousand to about fifty thousand during the two years they had been moderating. In 2011, they launched Examine.com, a website where people could find the kind of free, unbiased, up-to-date research and information on nutrition and supplements that they themselves had been looking for. They told people about their project, but they didn’t sell anything, and they only occasionally dropped links in the fitness subreddit when they were answering questions. Instead, other members of the community did it for them. After all, they had been part of Reddit at this point for about five years. Sol remembers they both had something like “100,000 plus karma,” a measure of how much a user has contributed to Reddit based on upvotes and comments from other users—so people trusted them, and they were solving a problem for the fitness subreddit without asking for anything in return. In 2013, two years after they started the site, they started to think about monetizing, so they surveyed the community about what problems they believed the information on Examine.com might be able to solve. “We would ask people, ‘What’s your problem? What do you wish you could do?’” Sol remembers. “The most common thing was ‘We wish you just had a table of all of the information you have. So if I wanted to look at supplements that affect blood pressure, I could look it up quickly.’”",642
Page 27,"Because of those answers, they offered their first product, the Research Digest, a comprehensive guide to supplements and nutrition. Sol was well known in the health and nutrition space, and to promote the Research Digest, he leveraged his relationships with fitness professionals four years after initially joining the fitness subreddit. When he and Kurtis launched, 105 people in the fitness industry shared the link. The goal was a thousand sales, and by the end of the first day they had already sold six to eight hundred copies. By the end of the launch, they had sold three thousand copies, all based on reputation, trust, and word of mouth. Fast-forward to today, and Sol is happy, healthy, and wealthy. Examine.com continues to be an important resource for health and nutrition professionals; it has seventy thousand visitors per day and does seven figures in annual revenue, though Sol has since stepped back from the day-to-day operations. The team has expanded Examine’s offerings to include additional guides and subscription services on how supplements factor not only into fitness but also into longevity, chronic disease, and psychological health. But they’ve never lost their focus on community and continue to depend on the trust and relationships that grew authentically over time. In this chapter, we’ll talk about how you can find your own communities (if you haven’t already) and how to uncover the kinds of problems that might be best suited for a minimalist business. I won’t lie. This process takes time, but done right and, most of all, done authentically, it will be the basis of how you move forward now and for years to come. Whether you’re just getting started or you’re already in the process of building a product, knowing and contributing to your community is key at every stage. Remember that, and you’ll find and nurture the right atmosphere for collaboration, growth, and eventually a sustainable business that matters. Community First Community is a fundamental societal unit. From Sol’s r/Fitness subreddit to yoga classes to family to the group of friends we game with in the middle of the night, communities are a place where we can connect, learn, and have fun. For minimalist entrepreneurs, communities are the starting point of any successful enterprise. That doesn’t mean you should run out and find a community to join just for the purpose of starting a business. It means that most businesses fail because they aren’t built with a particular group of people in mind. Often, the ones that succeed do so because they’re focused on a community that a founder knows well. That process can’t be rushed because it comes from authentic relationships and a willingness to serve, both of which take time to uncover and develop. You may even have to learn a new language—or at least some insider lingo. Communities used to be limited by geography, but it’s never been easier to connect to people with whom you share something in common, whether it be an interest, a favorite artist, or a belief system. But a community isn’t a group of people who all think, act, look, or behave the same. That’s a cult.",663
Page 28,"A community is the opposite. That’s what I discovered when I moved from San Francisco to Provo and got out of the Silicon Valley bubble. For one of the first times in my life, I saw that the best communities are made up of individuals who might be otherwise dissimilar but who have shared interests, values, and abilities. It’s a group of people who would likely never hang out with each other in any other situational context, and it often encompasses virtually every identity, including, yes, politics. A community can override people’s dislike of one another. Every Sunday in the Latter-day Saints Church, I saw the progressive next to the conservative, the rich next to the poor, the young next to the old. I’m not sure what they thought of each other outside the church building, but for at least one day a week, they sat together for the sake of the community. It wasn’t easy. It was real work to be an active participant in that church community, to learn how to speak the language, but for the first time in a long time, I was reminded of something important: you don’t have to bring your whole self to every community you join, but you do have to bring a slice of yourself. And that part needs to be authentic to its core. It’s the combination of time and vulnerability that leads to relationships and growth. Part of my own growth was realizing that as an outsider, I was in a particularly great position to see the community with fresh eyes and to contribute value in a new way. You may never move to a new city, but getting out of your bubble matters when it comes to community. And it’s healthy and normal to leave certain communities as you explore new ones.",369
Page 29,"You don’t have to bring your whole self to every community you join, but you do have to bring a slice of yourself. For me, my move from Silicon Valley to the Silicon Slopes showed me that I didn’t care too much about tech, at least not in the way that I thought I did. In Utah, I didn’t",79
Page 30,"go to JavaScript meetups or attend design lectures or judge startup pitch competitions. Instead, I found myself at figure drawing classes. Or a few hundred feet away from a barn, learning how to plein-air paint. Or at a coffee shop on Thursday mornings, writing and reviewing science-fiction stories with a few friends I met at a workshop. Finding these creative communities in real life reminded me of the spark that inspired me in the early days. And rediscovering myself as a creator and spending time with other makers reconnected me to why I had built Gumroad in the first place: I loved to create! I couldn’t believe I had forgotten that, for years. I was accidentally at the forefront of a movement that was taking shape—what Li Jin, former partner at Andreessen Horowitz and founder of Atelier Ventures, calls the “passion economy”—“a world in which people are able to do what they love for a living and to have a more fulfilling and purposeful life.” At the time I created Gumroad, online creator platforms were still new, but the rise of no-code solutions has made building and charging for podcasts, video and audio content, online courses, virtual teaching, and virtual coaching almost seamless, so that starting a business around something you love has never been more attainable. You probably have something you enjoy, something that on its face has nothing to do with your “real” job. Maybe it’s marathon running or ceramics or electronic music or another passion that you pursue in your free time. Whatever it is, building a minimalist business around the people you love to spend time with and the ways you love to spend your time depends on being part of a community. You may already be thinking about how to solve the problems of a current community you participate in, or you may simply be planning to join a community based on something you love. Either way, finding your people is really important at the beginning. Not just for the sake of your business but also for the sake of your own well-being. Taking writing and painting classes in Provo reminded me that my community wasn’t just the people in front of me; it was also a wider group who wanted, like me, to “turn their passions into livelihoods.” The real communities I was a part of didn’t care about growth at all costs; that kind of accelerated expansion would have cracked them into a million little pieces. Instead, their priority, like mine, was connecting to each other in ways that allowed for the space, time, and freedom to explore their interests and to eventually transform their passions into businesses in meaningful ways. Find Your People Many people struggle to consciously place themselves within communities, even though everyone is already a part of several. If you’re reading this and wondering which communities you’re already a part of, ask yourself these questions:",602
Page 31,"If I talk, who listens? Where and with whom do I already spend my time, online and offline? In what situations am I most authentically myself? Who do I hang out with, even though I don’t really like them, but it’s worth it since we share something more important in common?",70
Page 32,"Spend an hour, at least. Let yourself think you’ve run out of ideas at least a few times. In the list you end up creating, you’ll find the people you are meant to serve. You may be tempted to skip this exercise if you’ve already started a business, but I believe that doing this regularly is a good opportunity to remind yourself why you’re doing what you’re doing and, most important, who you’re doing it for. From here, you can turn your list of communities into a list of locations— geographic and online—in which to spend even more time learning and contributing: For every group with a shared interest, there’s a Facebook group, a Reddit community, a Twitter or Instagram hashtag, or some other form of gathering and sharing ideas on the web. There are often several. Join them all. There are communities run by the businesses that service that community: forums, groups, and more. Join those too. There are also notable teachers, with online classes that also function as communities. They may be also worth joining—though be mindful of the cost. Of course, there are the in-person communities! There are meetups, workshops, classes, speaker series, networking events, and more. It’s important to note that your goal here is to join communities, not networks. In a network, such as Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, newcomers start at zero. No one says “hi” when they walk in the door, and if you have something to say, there’s no guarantee that anyone will hear or help. Networks, in person or online, aren’t bad. Sometimes they can lead to genuine and meaningful connection, especially over time, as you gain friends and followers and the algorithms start to recommend your work and your content to people who don’t already know you. But where did those friends and followers come from in the first place? The communities you’re in! (Note: Networks and audience are really important for the minimalist entrepreneur, just not yet. We’ll cover them deeply in chapter 5.) Eventually, you will be part of various networks as the face of your business, but at the beginning, beware of believing that communities and networks are interchangeable, no matter how appealing the potential virality may seem. Instead, build deep relationships first.",496
Page 34,"Contribute, Create, and Teach",11
Page 35,"Being a member of a community is a start, but the real magic happens when you start to contribute. Authors and bloggers Ben McConnell and Jackie Huba call this the “1% Rule”: On the internet, they say, 1 percent create, 9 percent contribute, and 90 percent consume. They’ve shown this rule to be true when applied to sites like Wikipedia and Yahoo, and it’s also widely applicable to other collaborative websites. For example, most people do not post, comment, or even upvote on Reddit like Sol Orwell and Kurtis Frank did. Instead they browse anonymously, which is known as “lurking.” To cite one example, even when the r/Askreddit subreddit was getting 1.5 million unique visitors a day, it was only getting 2,674 submissions and 110,408 comments in the same period. If you contribute, you will have ten times the presence of someone who doesn’t. And it will continue to grow from there.",210
Page 36,"Contributing means commenting, editing, and generally being part of the broader conversation. What’s more, if you go further and create by showing what you’re working on, teaching what you’re learning, and bringing new material to your community, that influence will grow ninetyfold. Of course I am simplifying, but hopefully the point stands: While it’s better to lurk rather than needlessly comment, it’s even better to add value into the community even if you don’t feel that you’re ready. If you struggle with this, as many do, remind yourself that if you have something to add, it’s selfish to keep it to yourself! Once you begin contributing, folks will start recognizing your name. Eventually, some may seek your words of wisdom by “@mention”ing you directly or by following you so they get notified every time you post. When I lived in Utah, I met several painters who built communities and eventually businesses in this way. One example is landscape oil painter Bryan Mark Taylor, who was part of a community of painters and art enthusiasts participating in and attending plein-air painting competitions up and down the California coastline. He sold his work through these competitions and established a loyal group of collectors and fellow artists, who followed him to Instagram. There he grew his community by posting more of his work and educational videos. When his easel broke on a backpacking trip in the early 2010s, he created the first prototype of the Strada Easel to solve his own problem. And because his community had grown organically over a period of years and through a shared passion, he had thousands of other painters he could share it with who then wanted one for themselves. Today, the Strada Easel makes him and his employees a happy living, and he gets to paint as much as he wants. Once you’re regularly cultivating relationships by contributing to the conversation, the time will come when you’re ready to go further and educate others. But what will you say and how will you engage the people you’ve come to know and respect in your community? It’s all about creating value and can all be summed up by three signs Nathan Barry, the founder of ConvertKit, which provides email marketing for creators, has hanging in his office. They read: “Work in Public” “Teach Everything You Know” “Create Every Day” If you’re always learning, you’ll always have something to teach others about their own next best steps. When Nathan started blogging and publishing ebooks in 2006, he struggled to grow the community for his work, while others in his space seemed to have no trouble at all. One web designer he followed was Chris Coyier, who was regularly posting articles and tutorials on his website, CSS-Tricks.com. Chris had a following based on his articles, and in 2012 when he needed $3,500 for living expenses to take a month off to redesign his site, he promised recorded tutorials",637
Page 37,"about the redesign process in exchange for a contribution to his Kickstarter campaign. In short order, Chris raised $87,000. “I couldn’t help but think how Chris and I had equal skill sets when it came to web design,” Nathan writes. “We started at the same time and progressed at the same rate. So how did Chris have the ability to flip the switch and make $87,000 off a Kickstarter campaign and I didn’t have the ability at all? What was the difference?” They were both doing the work, but Chris was sharing it, while Nathan was not. “I realized I would take on a project, do the work, deliver the project and move on,” he said. “Chris did the same thing, BUT before he moved on, he would teach about everything he learned doing that project. When he could, he shared samples, he wrote tutorials about the code he wrote and any specific methods he went through. He did this with every project. The difference was that all along the way, Chris was teaching everything he knew and I wasn’t.” Since that epiphany, ConvertKit has grown to over $20 million in annual recurring revenue. Chances are, if you’ve learned something, there’s probably a good portion of your community that would find value in learning that same thing from you, even if you aren’t the world’s leading authority on the subject. And if you’re regularly learning, then you’ll always have regular content to contribute to the community. This can become a nice flywheel over time, as teaching often becomes the best way to drive your own curiosity and inspiration to learn more yourself. And when you learn publicly, your students will have questions that force you to learn even more stuff to teach them. You don’t have to teach everything you learn. In fact, a narrower core focus can be better. For example, Patrick McKenzie, a writer, entrepreneur, and software business expert who is best known for a 2012 post on salary negotiation that has since become a cult classic in the software engineering space, believes that the best personal brands exist at the intersection of two topics. He now works for Stripe, where he continues to write and advise software engineers and software entrepreneurs about how to start and scale their businesses, speaking from real experience as a creator and business owner himself.",503
Page 38,"If you’re learning every day, which you probably are, you’ll have something to share every day. Meanwhile, you’ll build your skills and experience, learn to speak the language, and grow your community, all essential ingredients when you eventually have a product you are ready to sell.",67
Page 39,"Unfortunately, as you probably already know, there are no shortcuts. As you think about what you’re creating now and how that might lead to a business in the future, look to the communities you’re already a part of. You’ve invested time and energy there, so perhaps you already have an idea of how to proceed. If you don’t, keep going, and continue using your time to get strong, to learn how to paint, to learn how to code, to learn how to write, or to learn whatever else you are into, teaching what you’re learning along the way. When you are proficient enough to monetize what you know, now or in the future, if you’ve put in the time, you will be part of a sizable community that will eventually be your first group of prospective customers (more on that in chapters 4 and 5). This is an important factor in keeping you honest about the quality of work you are able to produce. Your community should serve as proof that you’re improving, producing, and helping others; these people could spend their attention on a gazillion things, and they’ve chosen you. Becoming a person who helps people precedes building a business that helps people. It’s not a coincidence. When you become a pillar in a community, you gain exposure to the problems that the people within it face. People will come to you, explain their problems, and ask for your help in solving them. Overnight Success Is a Myth It took me a long time—until writing this book!—to realize how important communities were to my career. The Gumroad origin story I tell starts with me working as an early engineer at Pinterest. A few months in, on a Friday night, I was at home learning how to design a photorealistic icon for a side project. I came up with this:",394
Page 40,"I spent four hours, if I recall correctly. But if I had had a source file to work from, something to see how all the shadows and highlights and shapes came together, it would have taken me half that time. I would have totally paid money for that, at least a buck. And because I was part of a community of like-minded designers, I knew many",80
Page 41,"others would too. Not only that, but a subset of those designers followed me directly on Twitter—all potential customers. I looked around online, assuming it was going to be incredibly easy to sell something digital to my audience, but it wasn’t. It would have required setting up a whole storefront and paying a monthly fee. I had stubbed my toe on a problem—a concept we’ll explore in more detail later in this chapter. I built Gumroad that weekend, launched it Monday morning, and even sold a few copies of that pencil icon. But the classic origin story is incomplete. It turns out I had had a similar problem and thought process before, but I hadn’t decided to build Gumroad then. In a blog post from 2012, I wrote about trying unsuccessfully to find a way to sell the source code for a Twitter client app I built for the iPhone. I searched for a solution for a few hours, but I couldn’t find anything and gave up. A lot had changed in the years between the first time I imagined what would eventually become Gumroad and the second time, but the most important shift was that I had found my communities and had established myself within them by creating, contributing, learning, and teaching. When I had the idea the second time around, I was armed with the confidence, audience, and insights to solve a meaningful problem quickly and effectively. From the outside, it all seems so straightforward, but it took time not only to become part of the community but also to choose the community I wanted to serve and decide on the problem I wanted to solve. There’s really no such thing as overnight success. Most are years in the making, just like my ability to build Gumroad over a weekend was also many years in the works. When I was just getting started with web design, parents and teachers were my first clients (a social studies teacher needed a website for her books, while a parent needed help with the online presence of a local charity auction). Over time, I found like- minded web designers on web forums like TalkFreelance, self-described as a “forum for web designers and freelance developers” interested in website design, programming, search engine optimization, and more. Later, I found Hacker News, a site where most of Silicon Valley congregated online. At first, I was a lurker, then a commenter, and then an active contributor. And because my Twitter account was in my profile, as well as in my email signature, I started to collect a small following of people who signaled their interest in following me! Communities were essential for my personal development and career growth. They were where I made friends and formed business relationships. To this day, I am still meeting people who remember my name or handle from those years. I never had an agenda. I just knew I wanted to be part of Hacker News. And with their help, when I launched Gumroad that first Monday morning, it rocketed to the top of the front page of the site and stayed there all day. Even though that was just the beginning of my story, it was still confirmation that I had found my people and was where I belonged.",656
Page 42,Picking the Right Community,9
Page 43,"Once you are part of a community, you can start to make a list of difficulties its members face, and you can think about how you could build a product or service to solve one or more of them. Every community has a unique set of problems that’s calling out for a custom-built solution. You’re probably part of a number of communities, but when it comes to making an impact in a community in a way that leads to a minimalist business, you should focus on a community where you can (and want to): (1) create long-term value; (2) build relationships for decades to come; and (3) carve out a unique, authentic voice for yourself. For the minimalist entrepreneur trying to make an impact, community is a way to stay focused: Instead of changing the world, you can change your community’s world. It’s not enough to pick any community; you also have to consider your own interests. There are many communities that you may be a part of, but that doesn’t mean you want to dedicate a significant portion of your waking hours to solving their problems. Unless some element of the community and its problems overlap with something you’re passionate about, it is unlikely you would be happy operating a business within the space—contempt for your customers is not optimal. There are two more important attributes that will decide which is the ideal community to focus on: how large the community is, and how much money they are willing to spend (said differently: the total addressable market, or TAM). The goal here is not to find the largest community with the most dollars to spend in order to capture 1 percent of it. Instead, you should find something right in the middle. Too small, and you won’t be able to build a sustainable business. Too large, and it will cost too much money to get to sustainability in the first place—and you will attract or create competitors along the way, leading to a race to the bottom in product pricing that you may not survive. The best way to win is to be the only. And the best way to be the only is to pick a group that is Goldilocks size, has problems they would pay money to solve, and is underserved (likely because it is too small for larger competitors to go after). Tope Awotona, founder of Calendly, started three very different companies for three completely different communities before eventually building the scheduling software business in 2013. In 2020, Calendly posted nearly $70 million in annual recurring revenue, more than double its 2019 figure. But Awotona’s first company was a dating app that never really got off the ground. The second was projectorspot.com, which sold (obviously) projectors, but sales were poor and margins small. He tried again with a third startup, selling grills, but as he says, “I didn’t know anything about grills and I didn’t want to! I lived in an apartment, and never even grilled.” Not only was he not part of the grilling community, but he didn’t even want to be! He took a different approach to building Calendly. He had been a sales rep earlier in his career, and he knew the hassle of sending multiple emails to schedule meetings. He had even run into the scheduling problem while trying to sell his own products as an entrepreneur. As time went on and his other ideas failed to gain traction, he saw a gap",728
Page 44,"in the marketplace and resolved to address it for the community of sales reps he cared about and understood. He says that “the journey to creating something that’s impactful, something that serves people, something that you know people are willing to open up their wallets and pay for—is not something that you can do just for money.” While lots of people have scheduling fatigue, Awotona focused on problems specific to sales reps, which helped him define a problem he could both solve and monetize. What does that mean for you? First, get involved in those communities wherever they are, offline and online. Then, contribute, teach, and, most important, listen. Finally, use the filters above to make sure you are picking the right community to serve. Then, your problem becomes: Which problem should I pick? Picking the Right Problem to Solve The late Clayton Christensen described picking the right problem to solve as an opportunity to help customers achieve what they hope to achieve in a particular moment. “What [great companies] really need to home in on,” he wrote in a 2016 article for Harvard Business Review, “is the progress that the customer is trying to make in a given circumstance—what the customer hopes to accomplish: the job to be done.” For example, millions of people buy McDonald’s milkshakes. Why? Because McDonald’s found out that the job to be done was to accompany lonely drivers on their trips to work. “Nearly half the milkshakes were sold in the very early morning. It was the only thing [the customers] bought, they were always alone, and they always got in the car and drove off with it.” This is one reason why McDonald’s milkshakes are so viscous: so they last a whole, lonely car ride. Now, the McDonald’s marketing team can go into an office and create a problem that could potentially be solved only by their food. Then they can spend hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising to convince people that they have this problem, and that they too could “hire” a milkshake to get the job done. Christensen’s idea of “the job to be done” is sound, but McDonald’s is doing it in the wrong order. They didn’t start with the customer; they started with the job to be done, and then sank a ton of money into making customers believe they needed that job to be done. Minimalist entrepreneurs don’t have millions of dollars, nor do they want to manufacture problems for people. Instead, we believe that people already have enough problems, and that our role is to help them get rid of one. That is why it is so key to start with community. If you try to make something for everyone, you will likely end up making something that no one really wants or needs. Once you know the group of people you want to help, you will start to see their problems much more readily. There are more problems than businesses. You just have to find them.",640

Page 47,"You are not trying to create problems for people in order to solve them, à la McDonald’s. You are trying to discover inefficiencies in the lives of people you care about so you can help them. These may sound abstract, so let’s put the four types of utility in context.",67
Page 48,"A business that farms coffee beans in Ecuador and sells them in San Francisco is changing the “place” property of the beans. Place utility is what you are paying the premium for. If a coffee shop buys beans from a wholesaler and grinds them up, their customers are paying a premium for form utility. (They are also, in theory, paying a premium for place utility if the coffee shop is closer to them than the distributor is. Of course, many businesses are a combination.) If they also sell croissants that would take you three days to make, you are also paying a premium for time utility. Finally, if you decide it’s better for you to invest in a croissant-making machine to make your own croissants than to pay for them over and over again, that’s possession utility. One business that provides time utility is theCut, an app that connects barbers and clients and makes it faster and easier to find, book, and pay for services. Founders Obi Omile and Kush Patel came up with the idea after spending hours struggling to find barbers they liked and trusted. And getting an appointment with the best barbers often meant waiting hours because many used informal booking systems. TheCut provides utility for both sides. Clients save time, and barbers find new clients (possession utility), spend less time communicating with current ones (time utility), and receive mobile payments (form utility). Omile and Patel built a great business because they understood the problems that plagued the community they planned to serve. Once you’ve picked your own community, the path to the right solution will become clear for you too. Solving Your Own Problem Everyone has problems, “stubbing their toe” throughout their day. You may look around and think your life is pretty good, and maybe the folks around you do too. Or maybe the problems are obvious, and you already know what you want to build.",403
Page 49,"But most people, from my experience, miss these moments when they get whiplash from something being much harder or more painful than they initially expected. The brain adapts quickly, assuming the new state of things. It’s meant to be this hard, it thinks, or there’s a really good reason that it is, or it would be too annoying to change.",82
Page 50,"I think that’s the wrong way to go about life. Life is getting better all the time, and you can help accelerate the pace. Basecamp had their own version of this moment when they were struggling to find the right tool to manage products with their clients. As founder Jason Fried says, “We went looking for a tool to do this. What we found were ancient relics. To us, project management was all about communication. None of the software makers at the time seemed to agree. So we decided to make our own.” When they launched, they were already an essential part of the online product management and web design community, with a well-read blog and dozens of clients. How did this help them? In Jason’s words: “We decided early on that if we were able to generate around $5,000/month after a year (or about $60,000 in annual revenue), we’d have a good thing going. Turns out, we hit that number in about six weeks. So we absolutely were on to something.” When they had something ready to show their community, it turned out that many members had encountered the same roadblock. If you have a problem, other people probably do too. Like many chefs, Nick Kokonas regularly faced the issue of lost revenue from no-shows at his Chicago restaurants. In a bid to solve his own problem, he cofounded Tock, which manages demand through traditional reservations but also through ticketing, which allows diners to prepay for reservations and special events and permits restaurants to create “demand pricing” based on the desirability of reservation times. Prior to 2020, Tock was in thirty countries and two hundred cities, and was in use by thousands of restaurants, including some of the world’s best. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Tock innovated further by launching Tock to Go, which allows customers to reserve and purchase restaurant meals for pickup from restaurants that may not have offered takeout or delivery ever before. All of these businesses and many, many more hark back to community as a starting point. After all, if the problem you are solving for other people is also one you are solving for yourself, you will be able to kill a lot of birds with one stone. And if you build a product to solve your own problem, you will have at least one user—more than most startups ever get. Plus, you can talk to that user every single second of the day! Building the Right Solution Most businesses do not work, even if they are solving a real problem. This is often because while they are building something people want, they are not building it in the right way with the right minimalist mindset. So what kind of business can you build without a dollar of venture capital, appropriate to your skills and resources, in line with your mission, and viable in the marketplace? It is also important to ask: If your business achieves its potential, what kind of positive impact might it make on the world? That, not the lure of an IPO, should be the guiding light for the founders of a company and all of its employees.",653
Page 51,"These are the criteria I use: Will I love it? Building a business is hard and time-consuming. It will take years. And the more successful it is, the longer you will work on it. So it’s important to find something you want to work on, for people you want to work for. To build a successful business, you need to build something people love. To stick with it, you need to build something you love working on. Will it be inherently monetizable? There should be a clear path to charging people money for something of value, in a way that feels obvious. If it makes sense, it’ll make cents. Does it have an internal growth mechanism? In 2020, Gumroad’s revenues almost doubled due solely to word of mouth. In our case, it’s impossible to use the product without sharing it with other people, and as a result, we’ve been able to “outsource” our sales and marketing efforts because our customer base does the work for us as their customers use our platform. This is true of a lot of minimalist businesses, especially because you’re going to build a great product people want to tell others about, and that they may eventually want to use themselves. Do I have the right natural skill sets to build this business? For example, if the business requires a lot of business development or sales calls to get off the ground, and you are deathly scared of speaking to anyone, then it’s probably not a good fit for you. There are a lot of businesses waiting to be built—pick the right one for you. No one book contains everything you’ll need to know for starting any kind of business. The important thing is the thought process you bring to figuring things out for yourself. You need the right mindset and to know what questions to ask yourself. It begins and ends by thinking of your business as a tool to solve a customer’s problem. Not as a lottery ticket. Squashing Your Doubts Finally, even though you have an idea you are excited about and are confident you can build, at some point you will have doubts. Surround yourself with colleagues and mentors who will not only tell you the truth but will also encourage you when the going gets tough. After all, people need cheerleaders, not just advice. Inspiring (and inspired) founders and leaders are not born, they are made. Almost anyone can do it, with enough patience, guidance, and sincerity. A minimalist business can meet you where you are. It can grow with you as you grow (more on this in chapter 6). I would be lying if I said talent didn’t matter at all, but what truly makes great founders and great businesses in the long term is a great",576
Page 52,"deal of persistence. And one way to maximize your chances of success is to focus on a smaller product, on a community you are a core part of, and to be honest about whether you are solving the problem effectively or not. That’s why a mindful approach to selling to a community you already have a relationship with is so important. When you have doubts—and you will have doubts—go back to the fact that you’ve already started the work. By now, you will have (1) zeroed in on a mission-aligned problem to solve and (2) generated feasible ideas for a bootstrapped business that can tackle that problem profitably and sustainably. All you need to do from here, is to keep going. KEY TAKEAWAYS It’s the community that leads you to the problem, which leads you to the product, which leads you to your business. Once you’ve found community-you fit, start contributing with the intention of becoming a pillar in that community. Pick the right problem (it’s probably one you have), and confirm that others have it. Then confirm you have business-you fit too. When in doubt, always go back to the community.

Page 54,"The previous chapter was all about finding a problem worth solving for people worth solving it for. In this chapter, I explain how to develop your idea and how to figure out what you need to do now versus what can wait until you’re in business. Knowledge is important, but so is momentum. You don’t want to get so in the weeds on which programming language to learn that you never start making your dream app. Especially at the beginning, minimalist entrepreneurs have to stick to what is truly essential rather than try to learn and do everything all at once. While writers are often told to “write what you know,” for entrepreneurs the process isn’t so simple. When you’re starting a business, you’re often imagining something—a product, a service, a business model—that’s never been done before. That said, most successful minimalist entrepreneurs have a solid background (or interest) in one aspect of the business they’re starting even if they don’t know everything about it or exactly how to begin. For me, it was designing pretty, accessible software. When the iPhone App Store launched in 2008, I was one of its first wave of developers. Not because I was determined to start a business, but because I was following my passions and curiosity. Unfortunately, in my conversations with aspiring founders, this moment is when most folks decide that building a business is not for them. They have the passion, but they let self-doubt creep in, convincing themselves that they don’t possess the hard skills they think they need, such as iOS programming or financial modeling. Let me tell you a secret. Every founder, even the most successful ones, knows nothing at the beginning, and learns from there. This is about interests, not skills. Instead of focusing on the things you do not know, focus on the things you do. You do not need a team, money, or a degree to start building. You don’t need to ship or to code to make your idea come to life—at first. You might need them later, but when you are armed with a product that people truly value, these things will be easier and cheaper to acquire than you think. Often, they will find you. If your passion to solve a problem is genuine, you can overcome obstacles on your path one at a time. If you’re on a mission to serve customers, you can learn what you need to know and delegate the rest. Just figure out where your skills, knowledge, and background intersect with the business you have in mind and leverage these strengths to the hilt. Don’t get permission. Just get started.",555
Page 55,"Anna Gát, founder and CEO of Interintellect, was determined to build platforms where people could peacefully share their beliefs in spite of growing polarization in public intellectual and political spaces. The first inkling of the idea",48
Page 56,"had come to her between Brexit and the 2016 elections in the United States. Gát felt that a great cultural shift was happening, and she was eager to be part of creating the way the world would look in the years to come. It was a bold idea, but she had accomplished a similarly challenging task several years before as cofounder of Hungary’s leading women’s rights website and events community, for which she won a Glamour Woman of the Year Award. Now she was focused on creating mediated spaces that would allow people with irreconcilable opinions to come together. Her first iteration was a platform for academics where adversarial conversation and research could take place, but within a few months, she found working with that community to be a much slower process than she had anticipated. What she was building wasn’t scalable. Her second version of the product, a messaging app that would facilitate public discourse through artificial intelligence, was even more ambitious. For two years, she poured all of her energy, money, and time into building a new platform, working nights and spending every dollar she had to fund testing and development. Unfortunately, as the product moved closer to launch, many people who had said they would use the app were not as interested as they had indicated in preliminary research. “I was hell-bent on building technology,” she says, and the whole endeavor had been so expensive and time-consuming that she was reluctant to abandon it. But in the meantime, she was organizing in-person salons where people could share their opinions and ideas. She didn’t consider these gatherings to be a business, but she knew she had inadvertently created the vibrant intellectual community she had been seeking—it was just happening through the salons rather than through the app. Her entire career had been in tech, so building a company with zero tech felt counterintuitive. She abandoned the app anyway and pursued the “grander” idea based on the energy and fun she felt in the salon community. Now Interintellect is growing sustainably and realizing her initial dreams by way of a low-tech, systematized solution that reflects what her customers want and need. Later in this chapter we’ll talk more about Interintellect, but I get why so many people start with software or technology when building a business. I love it too, but it’s far too constricting at the beginning of the creative process. It makes the stakes too high, and it’s too serious, expensive, and stressful! That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t use engineering strategies to get started. It’s just that you don’t have to jump straight into coding or programming to create the processes that will power your minimalist business. The world will tell you to go big or go home, but I say go small at the beginning. And the smallest you could possibly start is to build nothing at all. Instead of skipping straight to software, stick with pen and paper.",618
Page 57,"Start with Process Every big idea was small first. If you don’t start small, if you can’t help people one by one, you will struggle to build a business around your idea. Leave your ego at the door, set aside your concerns about funding and software, and focus on your first customers, using your time and your expertise to solve real problems for real people. Now that people know you, trust you, and perhaps even turn to you for expertise, it is time to start helping them in a systematic, repeatable way that allows for continuous improvement and iteration. As you fulfill the first customer cycle, document each part of the process so that with every consecutive customer you have a playbook. This document will be the true MVP of your business. I’m not talking about the minimum viable product that we’re all trying to build and to launch. I’m talking about the manual valuable process that precedes it and will be the foundation for the business you’re trying to build. Methodically creating this manual valuable process and recording the steps you take to complete it will help you figure out what’s working and what isn’t. It will also help you discover if you’re making something that people actually need or will buy. In his book Anything You Want, CD Baby founder Derek Sivers writes, “If you want to make a movie recommendation service, start by telling friends to call you for movie recommendations. When you find a movie your friends like, they buy you a drink. Keep track of what you recommended and how your friends liked it, and improve from there.” Unfortunately, the English language does not have a word for this activity, so I made one up: processize (verb) to turn into a process: After they tested it on their friends, they processized their recommendation system. It really should be a word in the dictionary because it is so important on the path to building a business the right way. Unfortunately, many people miss this step, falter, and ultimately fail because they go straight from problem to product before learning exactly what and how to build. But processizing is a cheap, quick discovery process that is essential. “Creating a product is a process of discovery, not mere implementation. Technology is applied science,” Naval Ravikant says.",484
Page 58,"Without processization, you may think you know what the customer actually wants, maybe even because the customer has told you what they want, and maybe even what they would pay for. But as Anna Gát can tell us, talk is cheap. Until you get through the entire process of solving the customer’s problem and (ultimately) receiving payment, you won’t know what the customer wants and is willing to pay for. You need to solve one customer’s problem reasonably well, if imperfectly, before you can scale. If it works, great. If it doesn’t, you may realize you want to scale up, but your customers couldn’t care less. If that’s the case, you may want to consider a different idea. One minimalist business built on process is Endcrawl.com. For eight years, founder John “Pliny” Eremic ran a post-production company for the film industry and watched filmmakers struggle to produce the end credits that listed all of the people, places, and organizations that appeared in or contributed to the making of a film. He and his cofounder, Alan Grow, knew there had to be a better way, and the obvious answer was some kind of software to manage the endless changes and updates that made the process so painful. But they didn’t start there; instead, they set up a Google Sheet and a simple Perl script to build end credits to help them learn about their customers and validate some of their core assumptions. Their initial process looked like this: First, they gave customers a Google Sheet with their end credits formatted to their specifications. Customers could edit the Google Sheet as often and as much as they like. Once customers wanted a new “render” or video output of the credits, they emailed the request. Pliny or Alan manually exported their Google Sheet to CSV. Then they manually ran the CSV through the Perl script. Next, they manually uploaded the files to Dropbox. Finally, they manually emailed the customer the download link. For filmmakers used to waiting up to twenty-four hours, it was a revelation that this process, even manually, took only about fifteen minutes. It also allowed the customers to control their data and to do an unlimited number of revisions for a fixed price until the credits were just right. For customers, life was just a little bit better. For Pliny and Alan, it was a chance for discovery. Build Last",506
Page 59,"Even after you help your first few customers, you might not be totally sure how to solve the problem you have chosen to solve for your community, but one of the easiest ways to get started and to experiment is to freelance. Selling your time does not scale nearly as well as other types of businesses but can generate positive cash flow much sooner, giving you the breathing room to think about what comes next. Forms of self-employment income for developers",92
Page 60,"In my experience, many of the best minimalist businesses started out as freelance work or side projects before evolving into viable companies with potential for long-term growth. As you consider what exactly to build, there are a few routes that will get you to a profitable, sustainable business in the quickest, most efficient way. They are: Selling your knowledge and teaching people via digital content (videos, ebooks, podcasts, and courses). Lynda .com, which LinkedIn acquired in 2015, grew from a book and a series of in-person workshops led by Lynda Weinman. When the dot-com bubble burst in 2001, Lynda and her husband, Bruce Heavin, offered a subscription service to the online educational videos they made about web design, an idea that was new at the time. At first it seemed that the business would not survive, but as Lynda.com’s subscribers grew from just a few hundred to hundreds of thousands, their industry impact also expanded astronomically. Selling a physical product (merchandise or a unique product offering). Noxgear manufactures light-up visibility vests for runners and cyclists. The idea first came to cofounders Tom Walters and Simon Curran when they patched together a version of what would eventually become the Tracer360 for their nighttime ultimate Frisbee games. When they looked into what was available in the marketplace for early- morning and late-night athletes, they saw an opportunity, prototyped their product, and sold the first five hundred vests on Kickstarter. They’ve since added the Lighthound, a light-up harness for dogs. Connecting people for a flat or percentage fee. Craig Newmark started Craigslist as an email list among his friends, highlighting local events in the San Francisco Bay Area worth checking out. Today, they are doing over $1 billion in revenue per year, with fewer than a hundred employees. But while Craigslist is the quintessential example of connecting people, there are many ways to do this. Job boards, like People First Jobs (which we discuss in chapter 7 on culture and hiring), connect companies with candidates, often charging a flat fee for doing so. And there are communities too, like Product Manager HQ, that connect like-minded folks with each other. Software as a service (SaaS). The idea of building a software solution that would optimize remote work and minimize distractions came to Justin Mitchell and his team at Yac in 2018. In four days, they built the first iteration of what would eventually become their asynchronous voice messaging app for Product Hunt’s Makers Festival, because they",530
Page 61,"saw a hole in the market for remote workers who were constantly dealing with the demands of Zoom meetings and the distraction of Slack. Although YAC’s platform, integrations, and features have grown since then, it all began with the small idea of eliminating interruptions. In the last chapter we covered the four different kinds of economic utility: place, form, time and possession. To come up with your offering, you’ll likely overlay that list onto the list above to come up with the type of business that best solves the problem you’re trying to solve for your customers. For example, you may save people time (time utility) learning a new skill with an online, cohort- based course (digital content). Or you may build software (form utility) that automates a manual, physical process (SaaS). Over time, your business will likely offer two or more of these products and services, but at first, you should pick one to focus on and get started. In general, that should be the one that lets you begin today, instead of tomorrow. Remember that you don’t have to know everything about what you’re doing at the beginning (or ever), and many people are wrong the first time about what they are building. The fact is, it’s very likely that you discover the kind of business you should be building as you are building another business you thought you should be building. As Adam Wathan of Tailwind UI says, “Want to find a good SaaS idea? Start a business, literally any business. You will soon realize how bad every existing tool is that you have to pay for to run that business, and you will quickly become overwhelmed by the number of things you feel you need to build yourself.” If you make a false start, just go back, reset, and begin again. Nothing you’ve done or learned is ever wasted. A sustainable, growing business will take years to fully develop, and because you are growing as the business wishes you to, you have the time to make adjustments and learn the skills you need to know to succeed at each step. That’s because you are not doing this the unicorn way, which the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen refers to as “baking a cake in three minutes.” You are using your slow cooker to make a soup, on low heat and in full view. And if you’re not rushing, you have time to talk to customers, time to iterate, and time to test your hypothesis. Test Your Hypothesis A business hypothesis is just like the one you learned in fifth-grade science class. It is a suggested solution for a problem that does not currently have a solution. It",566
Page 62,"must be testable (able to be tested repeatedly and independently) and falsifiable (able to be proved wrong). For example: My customers will pay a fixed fee with a small premium to get their end credits quickly and efficiently produced with as many renders as they need. Every business starts by testing a hypothesis with real customers. And if you only have one customer, you can treat your startup like a white-glove service. This may mean a phone call or sitting across the table from your customer at a local coffee shop, helping them with their problem. The goal of these meetings is to validate this hypothesis. It takes time to test and honest reflection to recognize when you are wrong. But it is better to be wrong now, when the stakes are low, than to be wrong after you have spent five years and some of your own personal capital trying to build your idea into a business that was never meant to exist. When you are validating a hypothesis, do not ask leading questions—questions that point people to the answer you want to hear. Instead, think about creating the kind of feedback loop that author and tech entrepreneur Rob Fitzpatrick writes about in The Mom Test. When you ask the kind of questions he recommends, the kind even your mom can’t lie to you about, you will get the honest truth, because no one will know that you have a new idea for a business and that you’re testing to see if it’s viable. For example, you shouldn’t ask: Would you pay for my product? Instead, ask: Why haven’t you been able to fix this already? There are many businesses that cannot be proved in this way, but these are not the types of businesses we are interested in building. We’re aiming to build businesses that are testable at a small scale, and can then be scaled up gradually, over time. Another benefit of this approach: You can charge for it. If you are genuinely helping someone, you do not need to wait until you have a product to sell in order to make money. You can be paid for your time like Pliny and Alan were even before they technically had a “product.”",452
Page 63,"In their case, the process they created proved their hypothesis that filmmakers would pay for a solution to the problem of trying to finish the credits. Your first idea may not go as smoothly, and that is totally okay—most experiments are wrong. You are at the frontier, literally trying to make something that does not exist yet, and you will be wrong a lot on the way to figuring out what your customers want. As long as you are working toward being right through processization, you only have to be right once. And when you do arrive there, you will have a document that dictates your perfect process, because as you’ve walked someone through solving their problem, you’ve refined the steps it takes to get there. This process will take future customers from nothing to something. It’s something you can share (perhaps publish). You haven’t made any money. You don’t necessarily have a",192
Page 64,"business yet. But you’ve provided what Paul Graham, the founder of Y Combinator among many other endeavors, calls a “quantum of utility: when there is at least some set of users who would be excited to hear about it, because they can now do something they couldn’t do before.” Do One Thing Well Before I launched into research or coding or brand building, I picked a single problem to solve for myself and for my community of creators: selling digital files to their audiences. The basic assumption was simple, that people were starting their careers on the internet, some of them finding enormous success through social media rather than with websites and blogs. But at the end of the day, when they needed a platform to sell what they were making, they still wanted somewhere to send people and a streamlined way to deliver digital files and get paid for them. At its start, like any good product, Gumroad really only did one thing. The original Gumroad website reads: 1. Take a file or a link of value. This can be anything. From a link to an exclusive build of an app, to a secret blog post, to an icon you spent hours designing. 2. Share it. Just like any old link. Choose your own price. You don’t have to create a store. And you don’t have to do any management. 3. Make money. And that’s it. At the end of each month we’ll deposit the money you’ve earned to your PayPal account. If you think building an app like that is insanely complicated, it may be useful to know that most apps on the internet consist of two things: forms and lists. Twitter, for example, has a form you use to tweet (with a single input) and a list of tweets you see from people you follow. These apps are referred to as CRUD apps, as they have four actions you can take: Create, Read, Update, and Delete. And Twitter doesn’t even let you edit tweets! Gumroad fit this model. At first, I let a creator create, edit, and delete products, and allowed consumers to view them (“read” them). Stripe made payments easy to take, and PayPal made it easy for payouts to be sent out (albeit manually at first). Gumroad didn’t have file uploading at the time (you had to specify a destination URL post-purchase, like a YouTube URL), and I didn’t even have automated payouts or fee calculations. That was all manual.",536
